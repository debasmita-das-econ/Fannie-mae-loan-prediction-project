# Fannie Mae Loan Prediction Project
In this project, we want to predict whether or not loans acquired by Fannie Mae will go into foreclosure. 

Fannie Mae acquires loans from other lenders as a way of inducing them to lend more. Fannie Mae releases data on the loans it has acquired and their performance afterwards. 

## Access to Data
- For this project, I used Fannie Mae's Single-Family Historical Loan Performance Dataset 
- Fannie Mae provides loan performance data on a portion of its single-family mortgage loans to promote better understanding of the credit performance of Fannie Mae mortgage loans.
- It includes two datasets: Acquisition data and Performance data
- Data can be downloaded from [Fannie Mae's website](https://capitalmarkets.fanniemae.com/credit-risk-transfer/single-family-credit-risk-transfer/fannie-mae-single-family-loan-performance-data).
- Fannie Mae requires the user to register and create a unique username and password in order to access the performance data.
